# _"Interactive experiments in Toloka"_

## Contents:

This repository contains a code of oTree games (Public good game, Dictator game, Rock-Scissors-Paper etc) plus a few extra modules.

All the games are created with oTree version [3.4.0](https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/self/) (so called [`self`](https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/self/)).

The extra modules are the following:
- paymodule
- scraper
- toloka_front

All other folders are just oTree modules. To make the oTree project running in this folder just type 'otree devserver' (or 'otree prodserver' for production mode. For production mode read the [documentation](https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/self/server/intro.html) first. )
